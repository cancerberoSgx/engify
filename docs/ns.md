#Netsuite


Initially born as a proof of concept to see if netsuite scripts could be written in commons-js a la node. Also a personal research on different javascript implementations. 

for running in netsuite, just rename the file to .ss and run it as SuiteScript service. It works because test-src/index.js declares a global working service function.
